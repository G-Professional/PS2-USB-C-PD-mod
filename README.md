To Do:
 - redesign mount to secure board better. The usb-c part of the board tends to float up and down.
 - create a set of instructions.

Parts:
  - Trigger board -

Notes: 
  - output of stock PSU was 12.03V, triggerboard was 12.10V
  - connector of the psu to mobo is ambiguous, care must be taken to ensure orientation is correct.
  - personally, I dislike how incredibly tiny the trigger board is.

 - USB C PD info
   - perhaps in the future I would like to design my own trigger board
