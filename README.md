    - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LDJBN8P?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1

Notes: 
  - output of stock PSU was 12.03V, triggerboard was 12.10V
  - connector of the psu to mobo is ambiguous, care must be taken to ensure orientation is correct.
  - personally, I dislike how incredibly tiny the trigger board is.
  - I wonder if there's a way to incorporate a power switch like stock.
  - With the final design, the fitment is very tight. I'm not actually sure if the trigger module can be removed with out damaging it.
