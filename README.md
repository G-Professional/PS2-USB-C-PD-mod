# PS2-USB-C-PD-mod

This is a USB-C power mod for the PS2 SCPH 50001

To Do:
  - Desolder 4 pin connector from board
  - Design USB C trigger board mount that fits into power connector and switch slot.
  - 3d print trigger board mount

I am envisioning a mount that sits the trigger board on the ledge of the stock mount, this should be able to fit. Then the wires can be soldered onto the trigger board and go straight to the 4 pin connector.

Parts:
  - Trigger board -
